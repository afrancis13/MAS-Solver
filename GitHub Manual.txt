Version Control Manual
CS170 Programming Project

To place a branch of a repository on your local machine (the following example is for master)

git clone https://github.com/afrancis13/CS170-Programming-Project.git

To submit changes:

git add FILENAME1, FILENAME2, … (use -A flag to stage all files)
git commit -m “MESSAGE”
git push origin BRANCHNAME

To discover what branch you’re on:

git branch

To checkout a different branch:

git checkout BRANCHNAME

To rebase and merge changes from master (update your branch):

git pull origin master

To submit a pull request:

Go on GitHub. Press submit pull request and use the left branch as your own branch and right branch as master. This helps us to see the changes you want to make to master and then merge them in as we go. This way we can all work simultaneously without breaking each others shit.

This should get you most of the way there.
