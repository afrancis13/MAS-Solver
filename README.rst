This project was posed in December 2015 as a final exercise in applying approximation algorithms learned in the course CS170 at UC Berkeley.

The following paper documents findings on algorithmic performance, both in terms of runtime benchmarks, and ability to generate orderings that have high scores (number of forward edges in the ordering).
