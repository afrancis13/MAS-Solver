This project was posed in December 2015 as a final exercise in applying approximation algorithms learned in the course CS 170 at UC Berkeley. Credits for the tools in the staff package, as well as the proof in the document below, go to the CS 170 course staff.

The paper in this repository (under the name maximum-acyclic-subgraph.pdf, a work in progress, hopefully to be completed by the middle of May, 2016) documents findings on algorithmic performance, both in terms of runtime benchmarks, and ability to generate orderings that have high scores (number of forward edges in the ordering).
